# byeframe
Trim video clips using audio threshold

## Basic Usage

`python byeframe.py PATH_TO_VIDEO min_thres max_thresh thresh_duration`

And you should obtain an output at the same folder of the input video
called `out.ext`. `ext` is the extension of the input video.

## Dev Usage

Everything you need for trimming videos is in `trim.py`, if you'd like 
to use it in an api.
